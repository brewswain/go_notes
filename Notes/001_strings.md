# Strings

Go allows us to pass strings as arguments to Println. Strings can be defined directly within our code using string literals--text between double quotation marks that Go will treat as a string.

However, what's cool about this is that within our strings, characters like newlines, tabs, etc can be represented with escape sequences--A backslash followed by characters that represent another character(This is very similar to python in this regard).

Please see our text_formatting folder in apps that demonstrate the output of the below examples:

```
"Hello, \nGo!"

"Hello, \tGo!"

"Quotes:\"\""

"Backslash: \\"
```
