# Golang notes

Welcome to my infodump for learning golang!
I'm following along primarily with head first Go but ii'll also be using different resources as needed.

The folder structure is pretty self-explanatory, go to the "Notes" Folder for the Markdown files of any notes I may have taken.
Please note that this is supplementary knowledge and I won't be taking notes of _everything_. This is more meant as a reference point than as an instructional source, so there will most definitely be gaps in certain stuff (Think of this as more of a repo that has code examples with the occasional note tossed in.)

If there's some Golang exclusive stuff(To my knowledge, I'm just a JS/Python guy) then it'll be here, like Runes etc.
